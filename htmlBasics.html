    <h1> Spicy Water </h1>
    <br>

    <!-- The p stands for paragraphs -->
    <p>
        Many might think what is this guy talking about when they hear Spicy Water. I mean hot sauce might be spicy but water? No...
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The truth is far from what one may expect, let me explain.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Hot, cold, spicy, sour; these are all words used to describe things we consume daily. Yet when consuming water most only think of it being cold or hot, I can say this is wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        Spicy water fits into none of the categories from above yet also all of them. Spicy water is the type of water one has after a sports event on the hottest day of the month after grabbing it straight from the cooler.

        I can already hear the masses laughing, you are just describing cold water. Well if you think that you are half right. Spicy Water is not just cold water, it's the perfect cold on a hot day, or when it quenches your thirst in such a way one might hear the background music.
    <br>
    <p>
        Spicy Water is more than just water but I promise one day the world will know.
